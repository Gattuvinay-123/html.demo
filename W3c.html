    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>
      Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext
      browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose.

      Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex,
      the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York,
      <a href="https://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>,
      1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to
      "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold,
      but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.<br />

      Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in
      1967

    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>
      While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a
      notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to
      be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list
      of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under
      SINTRAN-III. See:

      Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep
